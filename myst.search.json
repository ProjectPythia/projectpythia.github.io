When we use the term\n“Python environment” here we are referring to the Python programming\nlanguage plus the myriad packages that go along with it. Because\nthere are so many Python packages available, maintaining interoperability\nbetween them is a huge challenge. To overcome some of these\ndifficulties the use of Anaconda or miniconda is required to manage\nyour Python ecosystem. These package managers allow you to create\na separate, custom Python environment for each specific Python set\nof tools. Yes, this unfortunately results in multiple copies of\nPython on your system, but it greatly reduces breaking toolchains\nwhenever a change is made to your Python environment (and is more\nreliable than any other solution we’ve encountered). Also, the use\nof Anaconda/Miniconda is standard practice for working with Python\nin general, not simply for using Pythia.\n\nThe steps:\n\nInstall either Anaconda or miniconda\n\nMake sure your conda is up to date by running this command from the terminal:conda update conda\n\nAt this point you have a current version of conda available on your\ndesktop or laptop. Before using your conda environment to work on\nPythia content, you’ll need to perform an addtional one-time setup\nthat is specific to each Pythia repo. After the one-time configuration is\ncomplete you will need to “activate” a repo-specific environment whenever\nyou wish to use it. Consult the repo-specific contributor’s guide\nfor information on “Building the site”, and\nfollow the steps described therein.\n\nNote\n\nRepository-specific contributor’s\ninformation can always be accessed by navigating your web browser\nto the appropriate Project Pythia GitHub repository,\n\n\nhere for\nexample, and clicking on the file named CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nMore information on installing and using conda may be found\n\n\nhere.","type":"content","url":"/portal/contributing#creating-a-python-environment-that-will-work-with-pythia","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Contributor’s Guide","lvl3":"Forking a repo","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/portal/contributing#forking-a-repo","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Contributor’s Guide","lvl3":"Forking a repo","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"content":"With Git, GitHub, and conda properly installed and configured, we are ready to\n“fork” a repository so\nthat you can safely make changes to the repository contents without\nchanging the Pythia repos until you are ready. Forking a repository\nas described below creates a clone of the Pythia repo under your\nown account on GitHub. Any changes you make to your repository will\nonly be seen by you until you are ready to share them with others,\nand hopefully “merge” your changes into one of the official Pythia\nrepositories.\n\nNote that the Pythia maintainers employ a version of the “Forking Workflow”\nto support contributions from the outside world. This workflow is\nsummarized below, and described in detail\n\n\nhere.\n\nThe steps:\n\nNavigate your web browser to the Pythia repository that you wish\nto contribute to. For example, \n\nhere.\n\nClick on the “Fork” icon (upper right). This will create a copy of the Pythia repository\non the GitHub server under your account name. You may be prompted\nto sign in. If so, use the GitHub (not Git) account name and password\nthat you created when you created your GitHub account above.\n\nAfter successfully forking a Pythia repo you should have a copy\nof that repository on the GitHub server under your account name.\nTo verify this you can navigate to the GitHub \n\nhome page, sign in if you are not\nalready, and click on “your repositories” under the pull down menu\nin the top right corner of the page. You should see the Pythia\nrepository you just cloned listed. Click on it. This is a remote\nclone of the Pythia repo. Changes you make to your copy will not\nimpact the contents of the Pythia repo. The next step is to make a\nlocal copy (clone) of the just-cloned GitHub repository on your\nlaptop or workstation.\n\nThat’s right. After this final step you will now have two copies\nof the repo, one local and one remote. From a terminal window type:$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/PYTHIA_REPO_NAME.git\n$ cd PYTHIA_REPO_NAME\n\nwhere YOUR_USER_NAME is your GitHub user name, and PYTHIA_REPO_NAME\nis the name of the Pythia repository that you wish to copy, for\nexample, pythia-foundations.\n\nThe git command above does two things, and it is important to\nunderstand them. Firstly, it creates a local repository inside of\nthe hidden directory PYTHIA_REPO_NAME/.git, that is populated with\nthe contents of the repository you are cloning. You should never\nneed to operate directly on the contents of the .git directory.\nSecondly, it creates a copy of the repo’s assets (e.g. Python files,\ndocumentation, etc.) in the local directory PYTHIA_REPO_NAME. The files in this latter directory are the ones that you will edit.\n\nRemember: you now essentially have two clones of the PYTHIA_REPO_NAME repository, one\non the GitHub server under your account, and one on your local\nworkstation or laptop.\n\nNext, connect your local copy of the repository to the “upstream” (remote) Pythia repository:$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ProjectPythia/PYTHIA_REPO_NAME.git\n\nFinally, create a new branch in your local repository:$ git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME\n\nWhere YOUR_BRANCH_NAME is the name that you want to give your local\nbranch. What name should you choose? If the work that you are doing\nis associated with a GitHub issue you should follow the convention:\n\nissue_XXX\n\nWhere XXX is the GitHub issue number. If it is not associated with a Pythia GitHub issue, pick something short and meaningful, e.g. “documentation_cleanup”.\n\nYou can now make changes to your local copy of the Pythia repo\nwithout having those changes affect either the remote Pythia GitHub\nrepo, your remote, personal GitHub repo, or your local repo in .git,\nuntil you are ready to merge your local changes upstream, first to\nyour .git local repo, then to your remote GitHub repo, and then\nultimately to the remote Pythia GitHub repo. Simple, right? More\non this later.\n\nFor further information see the \n\nGitHub docs on forking a repo.\n\nNote\n\nAt this point you should have a local copy of the repository\nin your current working directory. You can safely make changes to\nany of the contents. Once you are ready to contribute your changes\nback to the Pythia repository you will need to submit a Pull Request\n(PR), described later.","type":"content","url":"/portal/contributing#forking-a-repo","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Contributor’s Guide","lvl3":"Make your local changes","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/portal/contributing#make-your-local-changes","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Project Pythia Contributor’s Guide","lvl3":"Make your local changes","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"content":"At this point you should be able to make your desired changes to\nthe local copies of your files.

The merge will occur between your personal GitHub repository\nand the Pythia GitHub repository, so you first need to merge any\nchanges you’ve made in your local copy into your local .git repo.\nNext, you need to merge these local changes with your personal\nremote repo on GitHub. Finally, you need to submit a request to\nmerge your personal GitHub repo with the Pythia GitHub repo.\n\nGit has lots and lots of commands, each with lots and lots of\noptions. Here we only cover the very basics.

We are expecting 10 novel Cookbooks to join our gallery soon.\n\nFrom our post-hackathon exit survey, everyone enjoyed the event, felt that they learned new skills and that their contributions were valued. One scientist commented, “The hackathon for me has become a great place to get a sense of a community. Seeing people enthusiastic about coding up notebooks that would benefit the research community is a gateway for someone starting to code in Python.” This comment mirrors the efforts of Project Pythia as a community-owned resource.","type":"content","url":"/portal/posts/cookoff2023","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Pythia Cookbook Cook-Off Hackathon 2024 - Save the Date!"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/portal/posts/cookoff2024-savethedate","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Pythia Cookbook Cook-Off Hackathon 2024 - Save the Date!"},"content":"The 2024 Pythia Cookbook Cook-Off Hackathon will take place June\n11 - 14, at the NCAR Mesa Lab, located in Boulder, Colorado.

However, comparing the output of climate models directly with the paleoclimate observations is difficult: (1) they are often expressed in different quantities (i.e., temperature vs ring width), (2) paleoclimate observations have large time uncertainties, (3) paleoclimate observations often incorporate more than one environmental signal (i.e., temperature AND moisture).\n\nRecently, \n\nSteinman et al.
