## What is Project Pythia?

{button}`Learn More →<./about.md>`

{button}`About Pangeo →<https://pangeo.io>`

[Project Pythia](./about.md) is the education working group for [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io)
and is an educational resource for the entire geoscience community.
Together these initiatives are helping geoscientists make sense of huge volumes of
numerical scientific data using tools that facilitate open, reproducible science,
and building a [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)
around these goals.

Project Pythia is a home for Python-justified learning resources that are _open-source_,
_community-owned_, _geoscience-focused_, and _high-quality_.

## Start Learning

Project Pythia has several resources for you to use to start learning how to use Python
and the technology in the Python ecosystem for the geosciences.

The [Pythia Foundations Book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) is a
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) developed by the Pythia community to
act as a **comprehensive set of tutorials** covering the **foundational skills**
everyone needs to get started with **computing in the open-source Python ecosystem**.
These foundational tutorials will serve as common references for more advanced and
domain-specific content to be housed here in the Pythia Portal.

Pythia Cookbooks are collections of more advanced and domain-specific example workflows building on top of Pythia Foundations.

There is a wealth of educational resources out there on the internet for learning
Python and how to use it in the geosciences! We have attempted to gather together
a curated and filterable list of these resources (including Pythia's own content)
into our [Pythia Resource Gallery](/resource-gallery).
Click the link below to see a hand-picked selection of resources for learning at
your own pace.

The [Pythia Webinar Tutorial Series](https://ncar-xdev.github.io/status/tutorials.html) is hosted regularly by the Project Pythia team. Anyone can join
these hour-long, instructor-led interactive tutorials. Participants can
sit back and learn, or download a Jupyter Notebook and work along with
the instructor. Each seminar is recorded for later viewing on the
[Project Pythia YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZPBqJal5uKpO8ZiwzavCw).
Click the link below to view past and upcoming seminars, covering a range of
topics from beginning to advanced.

Looking for a free, public domain geoscience data set that you can use to
sharpen your skills while learning the Scientific Python Ecosystem? All of
the example data used by the [Pythia Foundations Book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org) are freely accessible.
