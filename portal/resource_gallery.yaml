  description: |
    This book grew out of a course developed at Columbia University called Research Computing in Earth Science. It was written mostly by Ryan Abernathey, with significant contributions from Kerry Key. By separating the book from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for python education in the Earth and Environmental Sciences.

  description: |
    We believe every researcher should know how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done. But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes, some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible. People who do this are called research software engineers; the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.

Next is an overview on how to display and save plots in the notebook, on the commandline, and from a script. Another section will introduce you to generating subplots from your data. Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API for specific types of data including streaming data, gridded data network graphs, geographic data, and timeseries data.

We'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in NumPy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, we'll learn just enough about matplotlib to display results from our examples.

    Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience. The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

    Xarray is inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas, the popular data analysis package focused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF files, which were the source of xarray’s data model, and integrates tightly with dask for parallel computing.

- title: The Earth Science Box Modelling Toolkit
  url: https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk
  description: |
    ESBMTK is a python library that aims to simplify typical box modeling projects in the Earth-Sciences.
    It uses a declarative approach to describe models, and abstracts typical modeling tasks like gas-exchange and carbonate dissolution through python classes. See the
    manual at https://esbmtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest for installation instructions usage, and example code.
