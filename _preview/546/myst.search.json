When we use the term\n“Python environment” here we are referring to the Python programming\nlanguage plus the myriad packages that go along with it. Because\nthere are so many Python packages available, maintaining interoperability\nbetween them is a huge challenge. To overcome some of these\ndifficulties the use of Anaconda or miniconda is required to manage\nyour Python ecosystem. These package managers allow you to create\na separate, custom Python environment for each specific Python set\nof tools. Yes, this unfortunately results in multiple copies of\nPython on your system, but it greatly reduces breaking toolchains\nwhenever a change is made to your Python environment (and is more\nreliable than any other solution we’ve encountered). Also, the use\nof Anaconda/Miniconda is standard practice for working with Python\nin general, not simply for using Pythia.\n\nThe steps:\n\nInstall either Anaconda or miniconda\n\nMake sure your conda is up to date by running this command from the terminal:conda update conda\n\nAt this point you have a current version of conda available on your\ndesktop or laptop. Before using your conda environment to work on\nPythia content, you’ll need to perform an addtional one-time setup\nthat is specific to each Pythia repo. After the one-time configuration is\ncomplete you will need to “activate” a repo-specific environment whenever\nyou wish to use it. Consult the repo-specific contribution guide\nfor information on “Building the site”, and\nfollow the steps described therein.\n\nNote\n\nRepository-specific contribution\ninformation can always be accessed by navigating your web browser\nto the appropriate Project Pythia GitHub repository,\n\n\nhere for\nexample, and clicking on the file named CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nMore information on installing and using conda may be found\n\n\nhere.","type":"content","url":"/contributing#creating-a-python-environment-that-will-work-with-pythia","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Contributing to Project Pythia","lvl3":"Forking a repo","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/contributing#forking-a-repo","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Contributing to Project Pythia","lvl3":"Forking a repo","lvl2":"Ready, set, fork!"},"content":"With Git, GitHub, and conda properly installed and configured, we are ready to\n“fork” a repository so\nthat you can safely make changes to the repository contents without\nchanging the Pythia repos until you are ready. Forking a repository\nas described below creates a clone of the Pythia repo under your\nown account on GitHub. Any changes you make to your repository will\nonly be seen by you until you are ready to share them with others,\nand hopefully “merge” your changes into one of the official Pythia\nrepositories.\n\nNote that the Pythia maintainers employ a version of the “Forking Workflow”\nto support contributions from the outside world. This workflow is\nsummarized below, and described in detail\n\n\nhere.\n\nThe steps:\n\nNavigate your web browser to the Pythia repository that you wish\nto contribute to. For example, \n\nhere.\n\nClick on the “Fork” icon (upper right). This will create a copy of the Pythia repository\non the GitHub server under your account name. You may be prompted\nto sign in. If so, use the GitHub (not Git) account name and password\nthat you created when you created your GitHub account above.\n\nAfter successfully forking a Pythia repo you should have a copy\nof that repository on the GitHub server under your account name.\nTo verify this you can navigate to the GitHub \n\nhome page, sign in if you are not\nalready, and click on “your repositories” under the pull down menu\nin the top right corner of the page. You should see the Pythia\nrepository you just cloned listed. Click on it. This is a remote\nclone of the Pythia repo. Changes you make to your copy will not\nimpact the contents of the Pythia repo. The next step is to make a\nlocal copy (clone) of the just-cloned GitHub repository on your\nlaptop or workstation.\n\nThat’s right. After this final step you will now have two copies\nof the repo, one local and one remote. From a terminal window type:$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/PYTHIA_REPO_NAME.git\n$ cd PYTHIA_REPO_NAME\n\nwhere YOUR_USER_NAME is your GitHub user name, and PYTHIA_REPO_NAME\nis the name of the Pythia repository that you wish to copy, for\nexample, pythia-foundations.\n\nThe git command above does two things, and it is important to\nunderstand them. Firstly, it creates a local repository inside of\nthe hidden directory PYTHIA_REPO_NAME/.git, that is populated with\nthe contents of the repository you are cloning. You should never\nneed to operate directly on the contents of the .git directory.\nSecondly, it creates a copy of the repo’s assets (e.g. Python files,\ndocumentation, etc.) in the local directory PYTHIA_REPO_NAME. The files in this latter directory are the ones that you will edit.\n\nRemember: you now essentially have two clones of the PYTHIA_REPO_NAME repository, one\non the GitHub server under your account, and one on your local\nworkstation or laptop.\n\nNext, connect your local copy of the repository to the “upstream” (remote) Pythia repository:$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ProjectPythia/PYTHIA_REPO_NAME.git\n\nFinally, create a new branch in your local repository:$ git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME\n\nWhere YOUR_BRANCH_NAME is the name that you want to give your local\nbranch. What name should you choose? If the work that you are doing\nis associated with a GitHub issue you should follow the convention:\n\nissue_XXX\n\nWhere XXX is the GitHub issue number.

We could update our Cookbook Template repository, but GitHub has no one way of sending those divergent-git-history changes to the various Cookbook repositories that leveraged that template. The MyST \n\nextends keyword in the configuration file allows us to not only abstract theming, but also configuration commands and content.

Knowing that there were paths that were pointing to the old sandbox “with MyST” GitHub organization, even Cookbooks that were previously transitioned to MyST would need to be combed through to make sure all updated changes were reflected. These changes included adding in the new boilerplate code to leverage MyST, updating all action calls, removing any stale code, and other miscellaneous changes to the README.md files and contribution guides.

However, comparing the output of climate models directly with the paleoclimate observations is difficult: (1) they are often expressed in different quantities (i.e., temperature vs ring width), (2) paleoclimate observations have large time uncertainties, (3) paleoclimate observations often incorporate more than one environmental signal (i.e., temperature AND moisture).\n\nRecently, \n\nSteinman et al.

This repository contains paleoclimate datasets that have been curated by the community and are archived in a standard format, facilitating analysis.\n\nContributors:\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/posts/2025/new-cookbooks#investigating-interhemispheric-precipitation-changes-over-the-past-millennium","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Hello world, new Cookbooks!","lvl3":"ESGF Cookbook","lvl2":"Cookbook round-up"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/posts/2025/new-cookbooks#esgf-cookbook","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Hello world, new Cookbooks!","lvl3":"ESGF Cookbook","lvl2":"Cookbook round-up"},"content":"\n\nAuthors: \n\nMax Grover, \n\nNathan Collier, \n\nCarsten Ehbrecht, \n\nJacqueline Nugent, and \n\nGerardo Rivera Tello\n\nGrover et al.

Most of the curriculum is focused around the Python ARM Toolkit. Once you go through this material, you will have the skills to read in radar data, apply data corrections, and visualize your data, building off of the core foundational Python material covered in the Foundations Book\n\nThe Example Workflows section contains a growing collection of real-world case studies.\n\nContributors:\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/posts/2025/new-cookbooks#radar-cookbook","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Hello world, new Cookbooks!","lvl3":"ARCO ERA-5 Interactive Visualization Cookbook","lvl2":"Cookbook round-up"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/posts/2025/new-cookbooks#arco-era-5-interactive-visualization-cookbook","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Hello world, new Cookbooks!","lvl3":"ARCO ERA-5 Interactive Visualization Cookbook","lvl2":"Cookbook round-up"},"content":"\n\nAuthors: \n\nKevin Tyle, \n\nMichael Barletta, \n\nNegin Sobhani, \n\nNicholas Cote , \n\nHarsha Hampapura , and \n\nPhilip Chmielowiec\n\nTyle et al.
