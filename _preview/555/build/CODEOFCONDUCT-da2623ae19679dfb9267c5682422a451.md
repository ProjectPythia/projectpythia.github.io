# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors, creators, stewards, and maintainers (collectively referred to as "contributors" below), of Project Pythia pledge to make participation in our software, system or hardware project and community a safe, productive, and welcoming experience for everyone. All contributors are required to abide by this Code of Conduct. This includes respectful treatment of everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, political affiliation, veteran status, pregnancy, genetic information, physical appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation, as well as any other characteristic protected under applicable US federal or state law.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Treating all contributors with respect and consideration
- Being considerate, respectful, and collaborative
- Communicating openly with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals and gracefully accepting criticism
- Acknowledging the contributions of others
- Avoiding personal attacks directed toward other contributors
- Being mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow contributors
- Alerting UCAR staff and suppliers/vendors if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress
- Respecting the rules and policies of the project and venue

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Physical, verbal, or written abuse by anyone to anyone
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Personal attacks directed at other guests, members, contributors, etc.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct
- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images
- Threatening or stalking anyone, including a contributor
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Project whether they be physical, online or face-to-face. This includes project code, code repository, associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media accounts, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Community Responsibilities

Everyone in the community is empowered to respond to people who are showing unacceptable behavior. They can talk to them privately or publicly. Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If the behavior continues, concerns may be brought to the project administrators (Read the next section to see who they are) or to any other party listed in the Reporting section below.

## Project Administrator Responsibilities

Project administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are encouraged to model appropriate behavior and provide support when people in the community point out inappropriate behavior. Project administrator(s) are normally the ones that would be tasked to carry out the actions in the Consequences section below.

Project administrators are also expected to keep this Code of Conduct updated with the main one housed at UCAR, as listed below in the Attribution section.

The list of project administrators, who are also Project Pythia's Principal Investigators (PIs), can be seen as follows:

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be brought to the attention of the project administrator(s), either by directly reaaching out to one of them (see the previous section for their individual GitHub profiles) or via the [`@ProjectPythia/core`](https://github.com/orgs/ProjectPythia/teams/core) GitHub handle and/or projectpythia@ucar.edu (the latter two may include more people than the project administrators though), who may take any reasonable and necessary action to address and stop the behavior. However, making a report to a project administrator is not considered an ‘official report’ to UCAR.

Instances of unacceptable behavior may also be reported:
- To [The Chief Human Resources Officer](chro@ucar.edu) who serves as UCAR’s Section 504, Title VI, VII and IX Coordinator;
- Through [UCAR’s Reporting a Concern website](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics); or
- Anonymously through [UCAR’s EthicsPoint Hotline](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics).

Complaints received by UCAR will be handled pursuant to the procedures outlined in [UCAR’s Complaint and Investigations Procedures](https://sundog.ucar.edu/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=5140). Complaints to UCAR will be held as confidential as practicable under the circumstances, and retaliation against a person who initiates a complaint or an inquiry about inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

If you require a reasonable accommodation due to a disability or for assistance as an individual with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), please contact UCAR's [Chief Human Resources Officer](chro@ucar.edu).

Any Contributor can use these reporting methods even if they are not directly affiliated with UCAR. The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for reporting is [here](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics).

## Confidentiality
**All reports will be kept confidential**. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior and take action on that pattern.

If a public statement is necessary, the identities of all individuals involved will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Conflicts of Interest

If a member of the project administrators has a conflict of interest regarding a report, they will recuse themselves from discussing and handling the incident. They will not have access to the incident documentation, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

## Consequences

Upon receipt of a complaint, the project administrator(s) may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. Such action can include things such as: removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, email, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or banning temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Project administrators also have the right to report violations to UCAR HR as well as to a contributor’s home institution and/or law enforcement. In the event an incident is reported to UCAR, UCAR will follow its Complaint and Investigations Procedure.

## Process for Changes

All UCAR managed projects are required to adopt this Contributor Code of Conduct. Adoption is assumed even if not expressly stated in the repository. Projects should fill in sections where prompted with project-specific information, including, project name and adoption date.

Projects that adopt this Code of Conduct need to stay up to date with UCAR's Contributor Code of Conduct, linked with a DOI in the Attribution section below. Projects can make limited substantive changes to the Code of Conduct, however, the changes must be limited in scope and may not contradict the UCAR Contributor Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct was originally adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4), version 1.4. We then aligned it with the UCAR Participant Code of Conduct, which also borrows from the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Code of Conduct. The UCAR Participant Code of Conduct applies to both UCAR employees as well as participants in activities run by UCAR. The original version of this for all software projects that have strong management from UCAR or UCAR staff is available on the UCAR website at [https://doi.org/10.5065/6w2c-a132](https://doi.org/10.5065/6w2c-a132). The date that it was adopted by this project was September 11, 2023. When responding to complaints, UCAR HR will do so based on the latest published version. Therefore, any project-specific changes should follow the Process for Changes section above.

As an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer and recipient of federal funds, UCAR complies with Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1975, as amended. See [UCAR’s Nondiscrimination Statement](https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/ethics-integrity/nondiscrimination).
