Knowing that there were paths that were pointing to the old sandbox “with MyST” GitHub organization, even Cookbooks that were previously transitioned to MyST would need to be combed through to make sure all updated changes were reflected. These changes included adding in the new boilerplate code to leverage MyST, updating all action calls, removing any stale code, and other miscellaneous changes to the README.md files and contribution guides.
